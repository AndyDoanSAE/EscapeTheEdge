# The Edge Escape Room
Project made at the Edge SLQ

The Edge Escape Room is a small puzzle/escape room style experience taking place at the Edge! The player will learn and utilise a few of the available technology and facilities (such as a 3D printer, laser printer etc.), and will need to find clues and solve puzzles in order to unlock doors that will lead to their escape!
